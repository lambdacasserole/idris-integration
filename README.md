# Riemann Integral Approximation in Idris
Riemann approximation of integrals in Idris.

## Future Work
It would be nice to define the trapezoidal rule separately and then prove that it is equivalent to the average of the right and left Riemann sums. Unfortunately I'm currently not sure where to start with this, whether or not the definitions in this library are amenable to this, or whether it is even possible right now.
